    Happy Mother’s Day to the most amazing woman I know—my mom. Thank you for being my backbone, my biggest supporter, and my safe place. Your love, strength, and guidance have carried me through every high and low, and I am endlessly grateful for you. I love you more than words can say, and I hope you always feel the love and appreciation you so deeply deserve. You are my everything, Mom. 💖
